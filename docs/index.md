## Theologies of the Digital Workshop 2019

This project is my contribution to the international workshop on Theologies of the Digital held in November 2019 at Princeton Theological Seminary. 

### Participants

All of the work I do is collaborative. In this project, my [Experimental Humanities team at Iliff](https://www.iliff.edu/experimental-humanities/) has been a core inspiration and partner in the work at all stages. I also hope that this space will allow for the other participants of the workshop to become collaborators in this project.
