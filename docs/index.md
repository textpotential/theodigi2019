# bible as interface: a digital theology

This is the working title for my contribution to our time together. I have so much to learn from each of you regarding each of the words in this title, but I will begin with a post giving you a chance to hear [how I am working with these terms](link to post on definitions) and we can discuss from there.
> I initially began with a title that ended with "a digital theology of bible." As I learn more about what theology can mean, I think it might be appropriate to suggest that bible as interface could offer a way of thinking about digital theology more generally. 

## Theologies of the Digital Workshop 2019

This project is my contribution to the international workshop on Theologies of the Digital held in November 2019 at Princeton Theological Seminary. 

### Participants

All of the work I do is collaborative. In this project, my [Experimental Humanities team at Iliff](https://www.iliff.edu/experimental-humanities/) has been a core inspiration and partner in the work at all stages. I also hope that this space will allow for the other participants of the workshop to become collaborators in this project.

I have enabled [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) on all pages of the site. Please feel free to pose questions or thoughts or additional resources or arguments, etc. using the hypothes.is tools. If you are interested in adding posts or editing existing posts, let me know and I can add you as a contributor in the repository and you can author away. I have struggled for years with the best way to translate the codex afforded "footnotes" into digital writing spaces. For this project, I will include my notes as either indentations within the text of as hypothes.is annotations. Please look for the annotation highlights while you read. Often, the most interesting places for engagement are in the margins, are they not?
