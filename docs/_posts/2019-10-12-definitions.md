As is often the case, I like to use the words of titles as launching places for a discussion of ideas. So, I will provide a brief account of how I am using each term in my title, "bible as interface: a digital theology," as a way of baselining our converesation.

> This may have to be multiple posts, but maybe I can be brief here and return to these definitions at other points.

## bible

A simple definition of bible might be a book containing the traditions considered sacred by the Christian tradition. Of course, this definiton is reductive on several levels, particularly lacking attention to the vast history of bible formation and the broad diversity of bible use.



As Timothy Beal has taught us, bible can mean many different things. I have no intention of providing an exhaustive definition of bible here

I am deeply indebted to Timothy Beal for what I find to be a much more interesting definiton of bible. Beal suggests that bible is a cultural icon that represents a notion of "completeness, wholeness, totality, correctness, etc." [Beal, yadda yadda](). 

## interface (maybe create separate post for this)
